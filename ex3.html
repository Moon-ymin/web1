        <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> engines were originally used only in web browsers,
        but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications.
        The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
        Although Java and <span class="js">JavaScript</span> are similar in name, syntax,
        and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
