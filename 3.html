  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers,
    but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications.
    The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
    Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax,
    and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
